            "AirCarbon is PHB and PHB is made naturally in almost all known life on Earth, from microorganisms and trees to the human body. When made with renewable power, the production of AirCarbon is a carbon-negative process, capturing or destroying more CO2e than was emitted to make it. AirCarbon molecule is a molecule made throughout nature, and can be re-consumed by natural microorganisms like leaves or twigs, enabling life to restore itself. Using AirCarbon, newlight technologies are making reusable, plastic-free, regenerative foodware, starting with drinking straws and cutlery.\n",

With B2Last®, BASF has developed an innovative bitumen additive that combines both asphalt performance and sustainability: Temperature-reduced paving with a high recycled asphalt content is made possible through the use of B2Last®, while guaranteeing consistent workability. This creates significantly lower bitumen and CO2 emissions, while the asphalt resistance is also increased, thereby extending the life span of the road. Moreover, B2Last® can be used in combination with typical elastomers to produce PmB (Polymer modified Bitumen), but also HiMA (Highly modified Asphalt), and fulfill all requirements needed for these types of products.\n",

            "SiSaf’s Bio-Courier drug delivery platform builds upon lipid nanoparticle technology with the introduction of silicon, for structural integrity and durability. The result is a nanoparticle with improved RNA loading capacity and protection from hydrolysis, combined with efficient transfection and controlled release of the oligonucleotide payload. Bio-Courier versatility is achieved by modifying particle size, surface charge and surface ligands for targeting to the desired site of drug action. Bio-Courier formulated drugs can be used for multiple routes of administration.\n",

            "Antisense oligonucleotides offer the ability to target and silence specific sequences of RNA. These molecules consist of a short segment of DNA flanked by two segments of RNA, linked with a phosphorothioate backbone. Both of these properties can be improved by the incorporation of a modified sugar in the RNA backbone, which changes the RNA segments to a similar but more effective molecule. This next-generation molecule is called Fluoroarabinonucleic acid, or 2’ F-ANA. FANA-ASOs effect gene silencing by finding mRNA complementary to their sequence. This FANA-RNA hybrid is recognized by a resident nuclease called RNAse H. RNAse H then cleaves the mRNA, preventing its translation into the protein it coded for. The FANA-ASO is then free to find and bind more mRNA, perpetuating mRNA target degradation and silencing the targeted gene. This process is illustrated and compared to a similar technology (siRNA).\n",
            "Somagenics’ proprietary synthetic short hairpin RNA (sshRNAs) can be highly potent RNAi triggers, with IC50’s in the low picomolar range. They have some distinct advantages over the more familiar siRNAs: They are synthesized as a single chemical entity, simplifying their production and purification and eliminating the risk of excess guide or \"passenger\" strand remaining after annealing to form the active duplex. sshRNAs differ from longer shRNAs, such as are typically used in vectors expressing siRNA precursors, in that they are too short to be Dicer substrates. Because they are synthetic molecules instead of vector-expressed products, the dosage and half-life in the body can be precisely controlled, with little or no interference with endogenous miRNA processing.\n",

Under external multiple ac magnetic fields, magnetic nanoparticles oscillate with the multiple ac magnetic fields via magnetic interaction. Thus, the reagent under external multiple ac magnetic fields shows a magnetic property, called mixed-frequency ac magnetic susceptibility Xac.

            "The isolation of nucleic acid molecules is achieved through their capturing by highly specific binding M-PVA Magnetic Beads that are subsequently attracted to metal rods transiently magnetized by an electromagnet. The magnetized rods transfer the M-PVA Magnetic Beads through the different process solutions, avoiding potential sample cross-contamination by not transferring any liquid. The rod rotation is switched on after deactivation of the electromagnet, leading to efficient and homogeneous resuspension of the particles during the sample resuspension and the subsequent washing steps. The procedure results in high yields of pure nucleic acids, low levels of fragmentation of the nucleic acid molecules, and success in all types of downstream applications. In the first step, the rods take up tips to protect them from contamination through sample material or resting particles. The next step is the attraction of the M-PVA Magnetic Beads that are subsequently immersed in the sample solution during the third step. Here, while the electromagnet is switched off, the M-PVA Magnetic Beads are rotated off the rods and bind to the DNA and RNA. \n",

Mystical solar roof tiles from Solinso can only be used in combination with some specific models of flat roof tiles.\n",

            "The Wavestar machine is under rebuilding and will be extended with two more floats and updated with a new state of the art power take-off system (PTO). The machine is consequently out of operation and live data are temporarily unavailable. The Wavestar machine draws energy from wave power with floats that rise and fall with the up and down motion of waves. The floats are attached by arms to a platform that stands on legs secured to the sea floor. The motion of the floats is transferred via hydraulics into the rotation of a generator, producing electricity.\n",
